### Well Hello ðŸ‘‹
#### My Github-self is happy to e-meet you, 
```
I'm passionate about developing data-quality estimation methods. Previously, I have worked on building neural machine translation systems for data-sparse systems and federated learning systems. 
Most of the work I have contributed to can be found here. Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at CMU (LTI). Prior to this, I was a SCAI Center Fellow at Microsoft Research India. 
If you find any critical inaqequacies in the work on this profile (I am quite sure, there are many ðŸ¤”) or have any questions about the work staged on this repository, you can reach out to me via my website. 
```
Thanks!
