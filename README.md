### Well Hello ðŸ‘‹
#### My Github-self is happy to e-meet you, 
```
I'm passionate about developing neural machine translation systems and privacy preserving deep learning models (specifically Federated Learning Systems). 
Most of the work I have contributed to can be found here. Iâ€™m currently working as a SCAI Center Fellow at Microsoft Research India. 
If you find any critical inaqequacies in the work on this profile (I am quite sure, there are many ðŸ¤”) or have any questions about the work staged on this repository, you can reach out to me via my website. 
```
Thanks!
